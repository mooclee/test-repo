Simply being a part of the HKRC stands for leaves me speechless everyday. Red Cross is the ideal service organization for a HKU student; it requires commitment and attendance, while meetings are efficient and very organized. Not only that, but it is possible to find a service activity for so many different interests, both on and off campus. Walking into a meeting, you will find a diverse group of students, but we all have one thing in common: we love to serve, and we are all genuinely nice people!',

		text:'The Global Citizenship Summer Institute (GCSI) provides a platform for Social Sciences students to step beyond their academic and physical borders, engaging in intellectual and experiential learning through participating in a four-week intensive study programme in Taiwan and South Korea. GCSI aims to enhance Social Sciences students\' awareness of the importance of Asia in the globalizing world. Students will spend first two weeks in Taiwan and following two weeks in South Korea attending academic lectures relating to three focus areas: social, cultural and political developments in Taiwan and South Korea. Students will critically examine these focus areas through a comparative lens as well as analyzing their regional and global implications. Field visits to civil society organizations and political and cultural parties will be organized to provide students with a more holistic understanding of Taiwanese and South Korean societies. By the end of these four weeks, students will gain a unique perspective on Asia through interacting with academics, students, community leaders and people in the selected Asian societies.',

Experiential learning is the process of learning through experience, and is more specifically defined as "learning through reflection on doing". Hands-on learning is a form of experiential learning but does not necessarily involve students reflecting on their product. Experiential learning is distinct from rote or didactic learning, in which the learner plays a comparatively passive role. It is related to but not synonymous with other forms of active learning such as action learning, adventure learning, free choice learning, cooperative learning, and service learning.',

"Bend your knees," he says and I have to obey. From behind, he pulls the strap until the rubber scrapes my skull. I hug my arms against my chest and crank my head back, making the shackles around my thighs tighten further. "Now," he commands, as I try to ignore the gap where the side of the aeroplane should be, "don’t forget to smile for the camera." And with that, we’re gone. Of course, there’s been a build up to my first sky dive. Hundreds of thousands of other people have already done this, including, I’m hoping, my instructor. I use this thought to keep me steady on the morning of the big day. I’ve met people who’ve done parachute-loads of these things, including those for whom it’s simply a matter of getting from A to B: barracks to war zone. Their plight puts my pre-jump jitters into perspective.',

I learnt so much on how to interact with different types of people and collaborate with other team members to bring the best outcomes. I feel very lucky to have good health, and able to contribute to others who might not be as lucky as I am. The HKU Service Network is a dynamic online platform specifically designed to help HKU students to contribute to global issues through joining and developing sustainable and innovative service projects. The platform enables students and NGOs to interact directly by way of exchanging service ideas and resources. While NGOs can recruit energetic volunteers and fresh ideas in the exchange, students can obtain professional advices and latest field information from front-line workers.',
