GCSI aims to enhance Social Sciences students' awareness of the importance of Asia in the globalizing world. Students will spend first two weeks in Taiwan and following two weeks in South Korea attending academic lectures relating to three focus areas: social, cultural and political developments in Taiwan and South Korea. Students will critically examine these focus areas through a comparative lens as well as analyzing their regional and global implications. Field visits to civil society organizations and political and cultural parties will be organized to provide students with a more holistic understanding of Taiwanese and South Korean societies. By the end of these four weeks, students will gain a unique perspective on Asia through interacting with academics, students, community leaders and people in the selected Asian societies.",

Skydiving is not just falling; it is flyingâ€”the closest we have been able to come to free, unencumbered, non-mechanical individual flight. \"Bend your knees,\" he says and I have to obey. From behind, he pulls the strap until the rubber scrapes my skull. I hug my arms against my chest and crank my head back, making the shackles around my thighs tighten further. \"Now,\" he commands, as I try to ignore the gap where the side of the aeroplane should be, \"donâ€™t forget to smile for the camera.\" And with that, weâ€™re gone. Of course, thereâ€™s been a build up to my first sky dive. Hundreds of thousands of other people have already done this, including, Iâ€™m hoping, my instructor. I use this thought to keep me steady on the morning of the big day. Iâ€™ve met people whoâ€™ve done parachute-loads of these things, including those for whom itâ€™s simply a matter of getting from A to B: barracks to war zone. Their plight puts my pre-jump jitters into perspective.",

The HKU Service Network is a dynamic online platform specifically designed to help HKU students to contribute to global issues through joining and developing sustainable and innovative service projects. The platform enables students and NGOs to interact directly by way of exchanging service ideas and resources. While NGOs can recruit energetic volunteers and fresh ideas in the exchange, students can obtain professional advices and latest field information from front-line workers.",

I was responsible to coordinate the Hong Kong sector, including collecting resources and materials to the east of China. I felt so grateful to love this opportunity to meet, learn and develop myself. Experiential learning is the process of learning through experience, and is more specifically defined as \"learning through reflection on doing\". Hands-on learning is a form of experiential learning but does not necessarily involve students reflecting on their product. Experiential learning is distinct from rote or didactic learning, in which the learner plays a comparatively passive role. It is related to but not synonymous with other forms of active learning such as action learning, adventure learning, free choice learning, cooperative learning, and service learning.",
